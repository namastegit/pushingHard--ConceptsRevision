// user: An optional object which may have a name property of type string or null. This is used to determine if the user is logged in or not. If the user object exists and potentially has a name, we assume the user is logged in.
// onSignin: A function that is supposed to be called when the user wants to log in.
// onSignout: A function that is supposed to be called when the user wants to log out.
{/* <Button onClick={user ? onSignout : onSignin}>{user ? "Logout" : "Login"}</Button>
If user is truthy (indicating a user is logged in), the button's onClick will be set to onSignout, and its children (the text inside the button) will be "Logout".
If user is falsy (indicating no user is logged in), the button's onClick will be set to onSignin, and its children will be "Login". */}
